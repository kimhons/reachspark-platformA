## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Firebase Functions Deployment Failures

**Issue**: Functions fail to deploy with timeout errors

**Solution**:
1. Check function size and complexity
2. Increase deployment timeout:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions --timeout=1800000
   ```
3. Deploy functions individually:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions:functionName1,functions:functionName2
   ```

**Issue**: "Error: Functions deploy had errors with the following functions"

**Solution**:
1. Check function logs:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log
   ```
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility
3. Check for syntax errors in function code
4. Verify all dependencies are properly installed

#### Firebase Hosting Deployment Issues

**Issue**: "Error: Deployment error"

**Solution**:
1. Check build output directory exists and contains index.html
2. Verify firebase.json configuration
3. Check hosting cache:
   ```bash
   firebase hosting:clearCache
   ```
4. Deploy with debug information:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting --debug
   ```

#### Environment Configuration Issues

**Issue**: "Error: Missing required environment variables"

**Solution**:
1. Verify .env files exist in all required locations
2. Check environment variable names match expected format
3. Run environment validation script:
   ```bash
   npm run validate:env
   ```
4. For CI/CD, verify secrets are properly configured

### Debugging Techniques

#### Firebase Functions Debugging

1. **Enable Verbose Logging**:
   ```javascript
   // In your function code
   console.log('Debug:', { data: someData, state: someState });
   ```

2. **View Logs in Real-Time**:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --tail
   ```

3. **Test Functions Locally**:
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start --only functions
   ```

#### Frontend Debugging

1. **Enable Source Maps in Production Build**:
   ```javascript
   // In next.config.js
   module.exports = {
     productionBrowserSourceMaps: true,
   }
   ```

2. **Use Browser Developer Tools** to inspect network requests and errors

3. **Enable Verbose Logging in Production**:
   ```javascript
   // Configure logging level
   window.LOG_LEVEL = 'debug';
   ```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring

ReachSpark includes comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

#### Firebase Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Initialize performance monitoring
import { getPerformance } from 'firebase/performance';
const perf = getPerformance(app);
```

#### Custom Metrics

```javascript
// Track custom performance metrics
function trackMetric(name, value) {
  // Log to Firebase Performance Monitoring
  const trace = perf.trace(name);
  trace.putMetric('value', value);
  trace.stop();
}
```

#### Error Tracking

```javascript
// Initialize crashlytics
import { initializeCrashlytics } from 'firebase/crashlytics';
const crashlytics = initializeCrashlytics(app);

// Log errors
try {
  // Operation that might fail
} catch (error) {
  crashlytics.recordError(error);
}
```

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

To keep ReachSpark running optimally, perform these maintenance tasks:

1. **Update Dependencies Regularly**:
   ```bash
   # Check for outdated packages
   pnpm outdated

   # Update packages
   pnpm update
   ```

2. **Run Security Audits**:
   ```bash
   # Check for vulnerabilities
   pnpm audit

   # Fix vulnerabilities
   pnpm audit fix
   ```

3. **Monitor Firebase Quotas and Usage**:
   ```bash
   # View Firebase usage
   firebase database:usage
   firebase firestore:usage
   firebase functions:usage
   ```

4. **Backup Firestore Data Regularly**:
   ```bash
   # Export Firestore data
   firebase firestore:export gs://your-backup-bucket/backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   ```

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

ReachSpark is designed for horizontal scaling to handle increased load:

#### Firebase Functions Scaling

1. **Implement Function Concurrency Control**:
   ```javascript
   // In firebase.json
   {
     "functions": {
       "concurrency": 10
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Use Regional Functions for Better Performance**:
   ```javascript
   // In functions/index.js
   exports.regionalFunction = functions
     .region('us-central1')
     .https.onCall((data, context) => {
       // Function code
     });
   ```

3. **Implement Rate Limiting for Public APIs**:
   ```javascript
   // Rate limiting middleware
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   app.use(rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   }));
   ```

#### Database Scaling

1. **Implement Sharding for High-Volume Collections**:
   ```javascript
   // Shard user data by first letter of username
   const shardId = username.charAt(0).toLowerCase();
   db.collection('users_sharded').doc(shardId).collection('users').doc(userId);
   ```

2. **Use Composite Indexes for Complex Queries**:
   ```javascript
   // In firestore.indexes.json
   {
     "indexes": [
       {
         "collectionGroup": "campaigns",
         "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
         "fields": [
           { "fieldPath": "status", "order": "ASCENDING" },
           { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Caching for Frequently Accessed Data**:
   ```javascript
   // Use Firebase Cache for REST APIs
   {
     "hosting": {
       "headers": [
         {
           "source": "/api/**",
           "headers": [
             {
               "key": "Cache-Control",
               "value": "public, max-age=300, s-maxage=600"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

### Vertical Scaling

For components that cannot be horizontally scaled, consider these vertical scaling options:

#### Function Memory Allocation

```javascript
// Increase memory allocation for compute-intensive functions
exports.intensiveFunction = functions
  .runWith({
    memory: '2GB',
    timeoutSeconds: 540
  })
  .https.onCall((data, context) => {
    // Function code
  });
```

#### Database Optimization

1. **Denormalize Data** for read-heavy operations
2. **Optimize Indexes** for specific query patterns
3. **Implement Query Caching** for expensive operations

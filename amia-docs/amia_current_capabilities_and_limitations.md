This document provides a comprehensive analysis of AMIA's current capabilities and limitations to inform strategic enhancement decisions.

## Core Architecture and Design Principles

The AMIA system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, allowing for independent development and testing of components. Each module implements a singleton pattern for consistent access across the application, with lazy loading to avoid circular dependencies. The system demonstrates thoughtful design principles including:

1. Robust error handling with centralized logging and standardized error types
2. Comprehensive test-mode support with mock implementations for external dependencies
3. Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
4. Configurable operation modes (default and client-specific)
5. Ethical boundary enforcement through dedicated checks

The architecture enables both standalone operation of individual modules and seamless integration in end-to-end workflows. However, the current implementation shows some inconsistencies in interface design across modules, and the dependency management approach, while functional, could benefit from more standardization.

## LLM Engine and Multi-Agent Ensemble

The LLM Engine module provides a sophisticated orchestration layer for multiple large language model providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic).

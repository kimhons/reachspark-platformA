# Enhanced Decision Framework Architecture

## Overview

The Enhanced Decision Framework is designed to provide AMIA with fully autonomous decision-making capabilities across all aspects of lead generation, qualification, and nurturing. Building on the existing implementation, this architecture introduces advanced capabilities in multi-agent orchestration, reinforcement learning, explainable AI, and adaptive decision strategies.

## Architectural Principles

The Enhanced Decision Framework adheres to the following architectural principles:

1. **Full Autonomy**: The framework operates independently with minimal human intervention, making complex decisions across the lead generation and nurturing lifecycle.

2. **Continuous Learning**: The system improves over time through reinforcement learning, feedback loops, and outcome analysis.

3. **Explainability**: All decisions include transparent reasoning and can be audited for compliance and trust.

4. **Resilience**: The framework includes fallback mechanisms, graceful degradation, and self-healing capabilities.

5. **Modularity**: Components are designed for independent development, testing, and upgrading.

6. **Event-Driven Communication**: Components interact through standardized events for loose coupling and scalability.

7. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between data, intelligence, orchestration, and interface layers.
